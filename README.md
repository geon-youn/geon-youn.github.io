# Geon's Personal Website

Welcome to [my website](https://geon-youn.github.io/)!

## Development

To start the project, run `npm run dev`. To publish changes to GitHub pages, run `npm run deploy`. Obviously run `npm install` to install dependencies first.

## Home Page

The home page displays the osu! logo with "osu" replaced by "geon" and recoloured orange. 

When you click on the logo, it expands to show different links: the play page, my resume, my GitHub, and closing the logo.

## Play Page (i.e. song selection)

Broken into 3 modes so far, which shows different "songs" depending on the mode.

When you click on the logo in the bottom right corner, it will take you to my osu! page.

Clicking on "LinkedIn" takes you to my LinkedIn page and clicking on "GitHub" takes you to this repo.

### geon! (About Me)

Each song tells you a little about me.

### geon!skills (My Skills)

Each song lists some of my skills.

### geon!projects (My Projects)

Each song lists one of the projects I worked on. 

If there's a repo to it, clicking on the song will open its repo in a new tab.

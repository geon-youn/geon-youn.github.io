# Geon's Personal Website

Made using React. A personal website with elements inspired by my hobbies.

## Routes

Uses hash routing because it's hosted on GitHub Pages and I want to use client routing. 

### [Home Page](https://geon-youn.github.io/)

Displays the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) logo, but with "osu" replaced with "geon" and recoloured orange. 

Click to expand it to show different links.

### [Play Page](https://geon-youn.github.io/#/play)

Based off the song selection screen in osu!. 

Change the modes to show different information on the right side of the screen.

Click the "geon!" button on the bottom right corner to open my osu! page in a new tab.
